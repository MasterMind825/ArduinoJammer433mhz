# üì° CC1101 with Arduino: 433 MHz Signal Interference

This repository provides a practical guide and working example for interfacing the CC1101 RF transceiver module with an Arduino Nano or UNO. It includes wiring instructions, setup guidance, and a script to generate broad interference across the 433 MHz ISM band ‚Äî commonly used by key fobs, garage doors, and basic wireless sensors.
